      My first impression of Dev Bootcamp is like I just got thrown into Hell Week with the Navy Seals! Actually it's not that bad but it is pretty tough.But tough is ok, because programming is tough and learning the tools of a programmer is difficult as well. While I have thought about programming before and looked at code I never realized how important it is to have good tools and workflow capabilities available to facilitate better coding. The first concept that really stuck out to me was version control software and the ideas behind this were difficult.

    But struggling and fighting through that complexity gave me a solid understanding of that idea and I now am very happy to have my computer up and running with remote access to my github repositories through the command line. I expected that Dev Bootcamp would be tough and it was, but I also thought I knew why it would be tough and I was mostly wrong. This has made DBC so far, fun and surprising as well as challenging. The experience so far has been great and I am looking forward to learning as much as I can in the next four short months.
