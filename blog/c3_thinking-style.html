      The Gregorc Thinking Style test has given me some insight into my learning tendencies and helped me pay attention to them. Taking an experimental, concrete and abstract random approach to solving problems can work for me well sometimes, but can slow me down if I make mistakes or need to go back to review my work.

      The experience at Dev Bootcamp so far has shown me that this I do need to keep my thinking style in mind when trying to attempt new material or solve difficult problems. When I take the time to re-read instructions and make a plan using psuedocode and refactoring that code I am more succesful in my solutions.

    While I try to have a growth mindset with coding, sometimes it helps to have a fixed mindset and not get ahead of myself. What I mean by this is that as an experimenting and random thinker I can lead myself to imagine tangents which are beyond my scope of programming ability and it can help to maintain a fixed mindset. Remaining focused on the task at hand and accepting your own limitations can help to motivate you to improve your coding skills and ability.
