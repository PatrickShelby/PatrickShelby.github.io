 <h1>Tech Issues</h1>

      An issue that seems prevalent in the tech industry which plagues companies as they start to see success is litigation and patent infringement lawsuits. This is a problem in many areas of creative fields as well as in inventive fields. It is a way to reward great accomplishments and protect individuals who are making valuable contributions, but it does not make for good business partnerships in the future. These strained relationships could come back to bite you if your competitors end up innovating beyond your capabilities.

      I don't have a solution to this problem but while reading about a new powerful transistor manufacturing process which has allowed Samsung to create very small (14 nm) vertically layered transistor where previous a competitor TSMC has only achieved a stable (20 nm) chip, while they have been forced to delay their release of the (16 nm) version because of technical issues.

      You can see the difference in manufacturing process from these two images:

    </div>
      The second one is the TSMC and employs 3 chips to achieve something close to the level of precision of the Samsung chip essentially. The Samsung chip does not necessarily show amazing gains here but it is a considerable advance in manufacturing capability, forcing people such as NVIDIA to the negotiating table with Samsung for their next generation after the Maxwell series called Pascal. They are buying chips from Samsung, despite the fact that they are currently engaged in a lawsuit with the Korean firm.
      Of course Samsung has agreed to manufacture more chips but I don't know how positevely this could affect their bargaining power.
