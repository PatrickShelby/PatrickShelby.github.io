 <h1>Feedback at DBC</h1>

  <h4>5/8/15</h4>

      While working with other people at Dev Bootcamp through pairing sessions I have learned way more than I thought I could, I think one emotion I feel with almost every pairing session is humility. My expectations for what the pairing sessions will be like are usually wrong, the sessions I think I will enjoy I find more tedious and the sessions I think will be tedious are enlightening and fun. The pairing sessions have taught me to be open to the experience of programming and have shown me how much can be accomplished collaboratively.

      I have found that a lot of sessions can really test my communication skills, and highlight areas where I can improve my effort and become better at coding. I think working with everyone else at DBC is fun and challenging because of how smart all of my classmates are, it can be difficult to prove to them that I belong in DBC and that I want to be here. I want to show everyone that I am hardworking and competent but there are always improvements I can make to show that. Getting feedback from my classmates has reinforced that, on sessions where I think I gave my best effort my partners have told me that I can do better. I take this feedback seriously, even though it can sometimes be hard to hear I am thankful that my classmates are critical, open, and honest.

    As I said, sometimes feedback can be hard to hear because I think I am really putting forth a lot of effort and hearing something else can be upsetting. Or worse sometimes I believe I can skate by on a challenge without someone noticing but later find out that my partner did not appreciate my lack of effort. I am getting better at receiving this feedback and know that I really need to give 110% and be able to drive and navigate when the time calls for it. I also need to be there to help my pair if they are struggling and be able to pull my own weight or else I will let other people down. This experience has already taught me a lot and again I am always humbled by what I can learn from others.
