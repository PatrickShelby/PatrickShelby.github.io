    Using Version Control is truly a marvel of modern computing and the ability to easily edit and make changes to programs while preserving an original copy protects programmers and professionals from the dread of losing their work! Using git makes this process very easy by keeping track of changes and then making them available for staging and commitment. This makes editing existing files easy and fast. By then linking this code remotely to a github repository we can share our code with others and work together to improve it!
